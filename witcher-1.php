<strong>The Witcher</strong><img src="img/The_Witcher_EU_box.jpg"> is a role-playing video game for the PC, developed by CD PROJEKT RED and published by Atari.
Based on The Witcher series of the same name by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, the game utilizes BioWare's proprietary Aurora Engine and was released in October 2007.
An enhanced edition of the game, containing among other things the editor and two new adventures: The Price of Neutrality premium module and Side Effects premium module, was released in September 2008.
In the first 10 months following its release, the game sold 800,000 copies worldwide.
A console version using an entirely new engine and combat system, titled The Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf, was planned for release in Fall 2009, but development was suspended indefinitely on May 6, 2009.</p>
<br>
<p>The Witcher follows the story of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher: a traveling monster hunter for hire, gifted with unnatural powers. Taking place in a fictional medieval world, the game implements detailed visuals. The natural light during various phases of the day is realistically altered, and the day and night transitions serve to enrich the game's ambiance. The weather can dynamically change from a light drizzle to a dark, stormy downpour accompanied by thunder and lightning, and the NPCs react to the rain by hiding under roofs trying to get out of the rain.</p>

<h2 id="Storyline" style="font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif">StoryLine</h2><hr>
<p>The game is centred on Geralt the witcher, also known as "the White Wolf", who at the beginning of the game suffers from amnesia. He gradually learns that he was a very renowned witcher, and that he had friends and enemies almost everywhere, who remember him but whom he does not remember. Through the player's actions, he will redefine those relationships and choose his path in the political intrigue that surrounds him.</p>


<br>
<h3 style="font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif">Story Motivation</h3>
<p>Story Motivations
    The developers have often said that their main goal with the game's storyline was to give choices to the player where there was no clear good or evil, and where the player would have to choose the lesser of two (or more) evils.[1]
    
    Also, the story was designed so that the consequences of the player's choices are often not immediately visible, and may only become apparent a few chapters later. This was done to prevent the "save, choose, reload" type of gameplay that is often used in similar computer role-playing games.</p>
   

<br>
    <h2 id="Gameplay" style="font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif">Gameplay</h2><hr>
    <p><img style="height: 160px;" src="img/download.jpg">There are three camera styles available when playing The Witcher. The game can be played from one of two top-down perspectives, in which case the mouse is used to control everything, or it can be played from an over-the-shoulder (OTS) view, which brings the player closer to the in-game combat, but limits visibility. In all three views the keyboard and mouse controls can be changed to be primarily mouse focused, or a combined keyboard-and-mouse approach.</p>
<p>The combat system in The Witcher represents a departure from most RPGs. Players choose one of three fighting styles. The quick style allows for faster, less-damaging attacks with a greater chance of hitting faster enemies; the heavy style deals more damage in exchange for a slow attack speed, and a lower chance to hit faster enemies; and the group style, which features sweeping attacks best used if the player is surrounded. The player can switch between the styles at any point.</p>
<p>Each of these stances has its own unique combat style. Both of Geralt's main swords, steel and silver, have distinctively different combat styles from the rest of his weaponry, and serve very distinct purposes: where the steel blade is used to fight humans and other flesh-and-blood beings, the silver is more effective against supernatural monsters and beasts (some of which may be completely unaffected by steel).</p>
<p>Alchemy is a major part of gameplay. The player can create potions that increase health or endurance regeneration, allow Geralt to see in the dark, or provide other beneficial effects. The recipes for these potions can be learned through scrolls, or by experimentation. Once the player creates an unknown potion he can choose to drink it, but if the potion is a failure it will poison the character. Each time Geralt drinks potions they increase the toxicity level of his body. This can be reduced by drinking a special potion or by meditating at an inn or fireplace.</p>
<p>In addition to potions, the player can also create oils and bombs, respectively used to augment the damage done by weapons, or as weapons in combat. Neither can be created until talent points have been allocated into the corresponding skills.</p>

<h2 id="Add-Ons" style="font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif">Add-Ons</h2><hr>
<h3>Enhanced Edition</h3>
<p>At the 2008 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, CD PROJEKT RED announced an enhanced edition of The Witcher, which contained a great number of technical upgrades, as well as a lot of new features, including two premium models: The Price of Neutrality premium module and Side Effects premium module.</p>
<h3>Adventures</h3>
<p>Adventures are self-contained modules created by those outside of CD PROJEKT RED. However, the ones listed below were later officially included into the main game with Patch 1.5:</p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Blight of the Bogs also known as Damn Those Swamps!</li>
    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Deceits</li>
    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Merry Witchmas</li>
    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The Wedding</li>
    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Wraiths of Quiet Hamlet</li>
</ul>
<h3>Canceled Add-Ons</h3>
<p>The Witcher: Scars of Betrayal is a canceled add-on for The Witcher. It was in development by Ossian Studios for some time in 2008 but was canceled.The Witcher: Outcast The Witcher: Outcast was a planned add-on for The Witcher that was in development by roXidy but was canceled.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="TechnicalInformation" style="font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif">Technical Information</h2><hr>
<p>The Witcher is powered by a new version of the BioWare Aurora Engine, modified for a single-player experience. A number of changes have been introduced to the original BioWare Aurora Engine, as well as troubleshooting and modding information, also described in the The Witcher technical information article.</p>


<br>
<h2 id="LocalizationVariations" style="font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif">Localization Variations</h2><hr>
<p>All the female portrait cards shown after Geralt's "conquests" were retouched to a more modest standard for the US release version. The in-game Dryad was also reskinned so her hair covered more of her body in this release.</p>
<p>Colorful dialogue between characters was cut in all English releases, especially through shortening of dialogue. Lead Designer Michał Madej has disputed claims by fans that this was due to the sometimes crude language, but that the decision to edit down dialogue occurred because of production-related concerns in game development. Proof reader Martin Pagan noticed this shortened version during his work and writer Sande Chen confirmed that it was not due to censorship. Fans have theorized that it may have been done for voice acting cost savings, especially since much of the vulgar language has been retained. Such cost savings would normally occur during any shortening of dialogue, even in cases where no major crudity was involved.</p>
